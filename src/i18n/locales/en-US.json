Only irreversible facial embeddings (mathematical representations of biometric features) are processed and stored, significantly reducing the risk of personal data exposure and simplifying compliance with national and international data protection regulations.\n\nKey features include facial login and identity verification, liveness detection to prevent spoofing attempts (such as photos, videos, or replays), biometric conflict detection, and session-based authentication with secure redirects. The architecture is multi-tenant, scalable, and suitable for onboarding flows, recurring logins, and high-risk actions.\n\nAuth Face is ideal for applications that require strong authentication, effective fraud prevention, and a frictionless passwordless user experience."
